# Book-recommender-system
An integrated system in which there is a database of graphically represented books in neo4j. Working with python as the base language, a recommendation system is created by using 
the technique of collaborative filtering. The user interface is a website that displays the books as well as the results of the predictions and allows a user to create a profile,
to use a combined search engine and to rate books with the help of python's web framework, Django.
